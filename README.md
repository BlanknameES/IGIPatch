# IGIPatch
A fan-made patch for Project IGI, currently in an early stage of development. Bug-fixing, QoL improvements and better compatibility with modern systems are the main goals of the patch.

# Installation
1. Find your IGI installation directory and backup the file 'pc\IGI.exe'.
2. Extract the contents of the ZIP archive (IGIPatchDLL_vx.xx_NoSetup.zip) to the root directory of your game, accept when prompted to replace IGI.exe.

# Configuration
Individual features of the patch can be tweaked by editing the file 'IGIPatch.ini' with a text editor (eg.: Notepad). Numeric constant '1' means true/enable, whereas '0' means false/disable.

# Current feature list - v0.10 (initial release)
- CD check removal.
- Improved timer resolution (up to 1ms).
- Fixed windows cursor being visible in windowed mode.
- Fixed cursor accuracy in fullscreen mode for menus.
